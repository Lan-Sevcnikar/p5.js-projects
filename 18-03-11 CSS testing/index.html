			<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10439823/1/Shrekvito-A-Love-Story-on-the-Set-of-Twins-II"><b> ShrekVito: A Love Story on the Set of Twins II </b> <br></a> It was a warm summer day when Danny DeVito walked onto the set of Twins II. A cavalcade of non-union crew workers, scriptwriters, and top-grossing actors swarmed the Universal Studios, making it hard for Danny to bustle his way to Czechoslovakian-born Canadian film producer and director Ivan Reitman, who is best known for his comedy work on films such as Meatballs, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2, and of course the classic 1988 masterpiece that is Twins. Twins was such a universally loved sucess that in the year 2015, the film executives decided to make a sequel. <br>"Hey Ivan, what am I supposed to be doin' right now?" asked DeVito in his surly, sexy New Jersey accent. <br>"We are about to shoot the scene where you and Schwarzenegger have to fight the evil alien mastermind." Ivan replied in his friendly, but not too friendly voice. <br>Danny began to get very excited at this prospect. It was the action ending sequence with aliens that made Danny so willing to sign onto the film in the first place. Danny began walking over to the Super Spacemarch Station set when he felt a sharp pain shoot across his face. Suddenly Danny was on the floor screeching in pain while a moist black sickness seeped into his clothes. <br>"Oh my, are you ok!?" A musty voice cried out in a heavy Scottish accent <br>"Yeah, I'll be fine" said Danny as he mustered himself to his feet. Danny looked up to see a beautiful man, standing 8-feet tall. <br>It took a minute for Danny to piece together what happened; The Scottish lad was an intern working on the set of Twins II. He was trying to deliver his coffee when his leg had ended up in the proximity of Danny's beautiful Hollywood mug, spilling the contents of the coffee cups on Danny. It's a miracle I survived that unfortunate injury, thought Danny, his knee is the same height as my face. <br>"Is everything alright?" Ivan said as he rushed to DeVito and the unnamed enigma Scottish lad. "Do I need to fire this intern?" <br>"Everything's fine Ivan," retorted Danny "There's no need to fire anyone today. I'll be fine, just let me go to my trailer to clean up." <br>"Ok. We'll schedule to shoot this scene tomorrow morning. Be ready." <br>Danny made his way to his large studio trailer before disrobing his coffee stained polo shirt, exposing his sexy, well-toned stomach. The years had made Danny's physique flabby and fleshy, but he was still very attractive for a man of his age. Danny found a towel in his trailer bathroom and rang the gooey, black substance from his thick coarse chest hair. For a reason unknown to Danny, he felt tempted to taste the ebony elixir. He took the hairy, moist towel and stuffed the entire thing in his mouth. How queer, Danny thought, It tastes just like onions. <br>Suddenly a chill ran through the air like a marathon runner runs through a track. The scent of onions pulsed through the air in an erotic aroma that made Danny pull down his britches and whip his long, uncircumcised penis in his hand. <br>"Who's there?" Danny asked while stroking his dick in a classy way. <br>A ghostly, Scottish voice replied "Oooooh Danny. Have you forgotten me already?" <br>Danny turned around to find himself face to knee with the 8-foot whelp of an intern that had spilled the coffee on him earlier. It wasn't until this moment that Danny realized this mysterious Scottish heartthrob was green of skin. Danny had seen this face before. <br>"I have seen your face before. Who could you be?" <br>"Oh, you may have seen me in a 2001 American computer-animated fantasy-comedy film produced by PDI/DreamWorks, released by DreamWorks Pictures, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, featuring the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow. It's entitled… Shrek." <br>Upon hearing those words, Danny fell to his knees. "Oh Shrek," he cried "How did I not recognize you?" <br>Shrek took his long, penis-like fingers and raised Danny's head. "It's ok little one. We all make mistakes. I will forgive you… If you will suck my penis." <br>"Ok" replied Danny. <br>Danny got to his feet and tried to undo the massive lace on Shrek's sexy alluring pants. It was like a small child trying to reach for a cookie jar on top of a refrigerator. <br>"Let me help you with that." Shrek snapped his fingers, and suddenly Danny and Shrek were 100% naked. It was awesome. <br>Shrek's massive donger reached all the way to the floor. Danny DeVito tried to put it in his mouth, but it was hopeless. <br>"It won't fit." Danny said hopelessly. Danny loved Shrek, and wanted to give him sexual pleasure, but he could not suffice. <br>"It's ok little one. You do have one other hole, remember?" <br>Shrek bent Danny upon the bed. A sudden, sharp pain swept across Danny DeVito's butt, followed by a wave of orgasmic pleasure. It hurts, but I do it for Shrek. <br>"Oh yes Shrek, put your pee-pee deeper in my booty hole" Danny cried out. <br>Shrek replied with a laugh. "Pee-Pee? My Pee-Pee is not in you yet. This is just a single finger." Shrek slip his index finger out of Danny DeVito, and placed his poop-smeared hand over Danny's face. "Try not to scream." <br>Suddenly the greatest feeling of all time went over Danny DeVito. It was like Chinese food, only better. In that moment, Danny DeVito was euphoric, not because of any phony god's blessing, but by Shrek's blessing. As Shrek came a thick, green, oniony semen, Danny began to feel a sudden power surge go throughout his entire body, not just his anus. At that moment Danny passed out. <br>When Danny arose the following moment, Shrek was gone. Danny got to his feet and began looking around his apartment for proof that last night had not been a satisfying wet dream, but had instead been a testimony of true love. Suddenly, a spurge came out of Danny's rear end. Danny reached his hand inside his own ass crack and took a handful of the anal contents. Danny brought the substance to his face. Green he though, bringing the gooey substance to his lips, and it tastes like onions. With that, Danny was certain that last night had been real. <br>Danny walked into his bathroom to behold a pleasureful sight in the mirror. Danny DeVito's hair had turned blonde. His normally balding hair was now shooting up in anime-like spikes. Danny's normal attire of polo shirts and jeans had become a long, flowing robe of yellow. This could mean only one thing, Danny thought, smiling. Shrek's cum has turned me into a Super Saiyan. <br>Danny DeVito's last thoughts where of Shrek's cum before he blasted through his trailer roof to fight crime. <br> <b> The End… For now.</b>

			The fire was hot, but some things are hotter than fire. <br> “I can’t believe I picked today to come back to the fire department,” Steve Buscemi muttered, running through the smoky lobby of the Hotel Le Bleu. He’d been fighting fires in New York City in some capacity since 1980, whether as a member of a company in Little Italy in his youth, or as a volunteer in Park Slope, Brooklyn. It was just one of the many fascinating facts that most people didn’t know about him. <br> “Someone’s stuck on the third floor!” one of the other firefighters yelled out. It’s not important who it was, he probably won’t come up in the story again. You can imagine him as a Joe Manganiello type if you’d like, and in your imagination he can be shirtless underneath his fireman’s coat, and have a Brooklyn accent as thick as Ragú.<br>“I’m on it!” Buscemi wheezed, and headed for the stairwell.<br>Hotel Le Bleu had caught fire early in the morning, when an irate guest had smashed a miniature champagne bottle onto one of its blue lights then lit their room on fire. It was an atypical morning, for sure. The hotel was known for two things: hiking up their prices 400% during Hurricane Sandy, and being sandwiched between a U-Haul center and a Pep Boys. The hotel was decorated like a middling Eastern European dance club, with extremely literal blue lights shining from its exterior at all times. Except today, when it was on fire.<br>It was the best the hotel had ever looked.<br>Steve Buscemi burst out of the third floor stairwell and looked to his left and right. “Which room?” he shouted.<br>“326,” another firefighter called back. You can imagine him as a Terry Crews type, if you’d like, although he wasn’t Terry Crews himself, because Terry Crews would never be unfaithful to his wife with you.<br>Steve Buscemi jogged down the hallway and kicked open the door to room 326. Dark smoke billowed out of the room, obscuring which firefighters looked like Terry Crews and which firefighters looked like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson except not out of your league. “I’m going in!” Steve yelled.<br>He found who they were looking for immediately. All five feet and zero inches of him were lying flat on his back, with a cigar in his mouth, wearing nothing but white underpants, unconscious.<br>“Oh my god, it’s Danny DeVito!” said a firefighter who had previously shown an embarrassing amount of unchill when he’d met Steve Buscemi for the first time.<br>But Steve Buscemi didn’t waste any time yelling out people’s names, like we’re all idiots who don’t know that Danny DeVito both directed AND starred in Matilda. No, he hoisted the beloved television star over his shoulder, and he got the hell out of there!<br>Three flights of stairs and one quick jog past the Continental breakfast bar later (just to see if there was anything good left), Steve Buscemi knelt beside Danny DeVito in the parking lot and began administering CPR. It was the kind of sexy CPR that only transpires between teenagers on summer vacation, yet it was happening here, between two celebrated character actors in a congested area of Brooklyn. And even though one actor was nine inches taller than the other, and the other one was unconscious, the paramedic who witnessed it said it was the most romantic moment of his life, and he’d been on a hot air balloon, buddy.<br>At last, Danny DeVito spluttered, coughed, and came back to life. “Boosh!” he rasped. “I haven’t seen you since we both worked together on the 2003 film Big Fish!”<br>“Shh, shh.” Steve Buscemi put a finger to Danny DeVito’s lips. “You don’t have to speak.”<br>DeVito sat up. “But I feel like chatting!”<br>“Oh, okay then.” Buscemi shrugged. “I just didn’t want to make you feel like you, you know, HAD to. How’re the kids?”<br>“Great, great,” Danny DeVito smiled, returning Steve Buscemi’s hypnotic gaze. “Hey, do you guys know who started this thing?”<br>“We’re still investigating leads,” said a police officer who’d been rudely eavesdropping on their intimate moment. He looked like any number of rappers who’ve given up writing songs about the police to play them in film and television.<br>“It was me!” Danny DeVito leaped to his feet. Again, he was naked but for a pair of white underpants. The eye didn’t quite know where to land. “I’d had enough of these stupid blue lights, and I burned the joint down!”<br>It was difficult then to say who started laughing first: Steve Buscemi, who is so cool, he was on The Adventures of Pete and Pete; or Danny DeVito, who once drank so many limoncellos with George Clooney that he called George W. Bush “numbnuts” on The View<br>It was even more difficult, a few seconds later, to decipher who started kissing whom first. But once the passions of these two esteemed performers were ignited, well, it seemed like nothing could stop them. Not New York City firefighters, nor time, nor the certain implosion of their personal lives.<br>Nothing, that is, until he showed up. “Hey!” a strangled voice rang out. A crowd had gathered in the parking lot to watch Steve Buscemi make out with Danny DeVito, and it was impossible to tell who’d spoken. The two actors paused for a moment in their revelry. “I said, hey!” the voice came again.<br>Slowly, person by person, the crowd parted to make way for him. A few gasps of recognition rose out of the mass, but they were subdued. Even the unchill fireman from before was able to calmly handle this celebrity sighting, for it was…<br>“Paul Giamatti!” Danny DeVito yelped. “I haven’t seen you since we worked together the 1999 film Man on the Moon!”<br>“I know,” said Paul Giamatti, taking off his shirt. “But gentlemen, this was one supporting role I just couldn’t resist.”<br>
